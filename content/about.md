# About

My name is Daniel. My interests are self-hosting, making (3D printing and amateur electronics), travel, bitcoin and more! To pay the bills I work as a web developer.

I've recently become interested in the IndieWeb and hence this blog was finally born (see my [first post]() to understand why I use the word "finally").

I'm writing this blog primarily for myself. Partially to unload thoughts and content out of my brain, partially to document how my thinking changes over time, and partially for the enjoyment of writing. However, if someone else finds something here useful or thought-provoking that is definitely a bonus!
